# Node.js Project Template: Your Base for Scalable Applications

This repository provides a robust Node.js project template designed with essential coding principles and project management recommendations. Whether you're building a small application or a large-scale project, this template is flexible and ready to be tailored to your needs. Feel free to modify it as required.

## Directory Structure

### `src`
The `src` folder is the core of the project, containing all source code. Tests are excluded here, and you may consider creating a separate folder for them. Let's explore the key subfolders inside `src`:

- **`config`**:
  This folder handles the configuration and setup of libraries or modules. Examples include:
  - Setting up `dotenv` for managing environment variables efficiently (see `server-config.js`).
  - Configuring a logging library to generate meaningful logs.

- **`routes`**:
  Contains route definitions, registering them alongside their corresponding middleware and controllers.

- **`middlewares`**:
  Intercepts incoming requests to perform tasks like validation and authentication.

- **`controllers`**:
  Acts as the final middleware before invoking the business logic. Controllers:
  - Receive incoming requests and data.
  - Pass data to the business layer.
  - Structure API responses and send outputs after processing.

- **`repositories`**:
  Handles all database interactions by writing raw or ORM queries.

- **`services`**:
  Implements business logic and communicates with repositories to fetch data from the database.

- **`utils`**:
  Contains utility functions, helper methods, error classes, and other shared resources.

## Setting Up the Project

### 1. Clone the Template
Download this template from GitHub and open it in your favorite text editor.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and run:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
In the root directory, create a `.env` file and define the following variables:
```env
PORT=<port number of your choice>
```
Example:
```env
PORT=3000
```

### 4. Initialize Sequelize
Navigate to the `src` folder and execute:
```bash
npx sequelize init
```
This command will generate `migrations` and `seeders` folders, along with a `config.json` file inside the `config` folder.

### 5. Configure Database
In `config.json`:
- For development, specify the database `username`, `password`, and `dialect` (e.g., `mysql`, `mariadb`, etc.).
- For testing or production, replace the `host` field with the hosted database URL.

### 6. Start the Server
To start the development server, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Why Use This Template?
- Streamlined project structure for clarity and scalability.
- Adherence to best practices in coding and project management.
- Flexible configurations to suit various environments.
